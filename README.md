Carpentry modeling using CSG

Many customers these days want to have custom manufactured products. On example is the manufacturing of
carpentry elements (e.g. custom doors or windows). Production of such products can be customized using
different approaches, one being use of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), which allows parametrization of
individual model for individual manufactured product [1].
The goal of this seminar is to develop the web-based application for defining the custom doors. The application
must take as an input several models which define the basic parameters of the final door (such as door profile,
door frame profile) and must allow the definition of door appearance with additional restriction/parameters (so
that doors can be fitted for different sizes, and so that the user can define the detailed composition of door with a
sketch). The application must support sketches of standard formats (e.g. SolidWorks or AutoCAD). The
application must allow the positioning of custom elements on doors (such as handles, holes etc.).
